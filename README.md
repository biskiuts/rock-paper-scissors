# RPG Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is an enhanced version of the classic **Rock**, **Paper**, **Scissors** game, reimagined with an RPG twist. In this version:

- **Rock** is represented by the Warrior class
- **Paper** is represented by the Mage class
- **Scissors** is represented by the Archer class

Each class has unique attributes and abilities, making the gameplay feel more immersive and strategic. Instead of just selecting a "rock," "paper," or "scissors," players will choose a class, each with its own strengths and weaknesses against the others.

## Game Overview

In this game:

- **Warrior (Rock)** is strong against the Archer (Scissors), but weak against the Mage (Paper).

- **Mage (Paper)** is powerful against the Warrior (Rock), but vulnerable to the Archer (Scissors).

- **Archer (Scissors)** excels against the Mage (Paper), but falls short against the Warrior (Rock).

The goal is to select a class (Warrior, Mage, or Archer) and challenge the Computer in a battle of strength, magic, or precision. The outcome of the battle is determined based on a set of predefined rules, where each class has advantages and disadvantages over others.
